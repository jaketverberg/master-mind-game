Mastermind
This project is part of the The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

Game Description
There are many variations of Mastermind, according to Wikipedia. I chose to use the original game rules. There are 6 different color that form a 4 peg "cipher" that another player tries to break in 12 guesses. After each guess, they receive feedback on the number of colors that were accurate or if that color was also in the correct spot.

Instructions
This Mastermind game is a 1-player game, that is played in the command line. You can choose to be a code-breaker or a code-maker to create a code for the computer to break. For this program, each color guess or cipher input is typed by their designated name (red, green, blue, etc.), which will be displayed on the console. Additional instructions will be displayed at the beginning of every game.

The simplest way to play the game is through repl.it. To play, simply click on the green 'run' button at the top of the repl.it game page.
Otherwise, you may clone this repo and run main.rb in the command line.
